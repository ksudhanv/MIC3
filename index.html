                <p>XLR is to date the largest vessel made by one man, at roughly 30ft x 30ft this absolute behemoth is a mrvel of human achievement, especially when you consider how shoddily it was made.  occasionally random screws will be found inside and nobody knows where they came from or if the ship is even stable.</p>

                <p>Ship 800 is actually one of the first vessels we launched into space, its location is still unknown but we occasionally recieve transmissions from it indicating a very large threat heading straight for earth... how exciting!</p>
